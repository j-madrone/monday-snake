# Snake

My take on the classic game of snake, now with two player mode!

Built for Monday.com using Node and Express.js

I used jQuery to draw and redraw the snakes using absolutely positioned `img`'s on a loop.

Each snake uses a cache to avoid issues with ultra-fast keyboard inputs.

## Installation Instructions
- Install Node.js
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
- Open http://localhost:8031 and enjoy!
